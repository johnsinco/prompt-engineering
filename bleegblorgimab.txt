Bleegblorgumab in Conjunction with Prednisolone in HER2+ MBC Patients: An
Open Label Study

Introduction: 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (HER2+ MBC) accounts for
approximately 20% of all breast cancer cases and is associated with an
aggressive disease course and poor prognosis. Although targeted therapies, such
as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, have improved outcomes in HER2+ MBC, resistance
and disease progression remain significant challenges. Therefore, there is a
need to explore novel therapeutic approaches to overcome treatment resistance
and further improve patient outcomes.

Bleegblorgumab is a monoclonal antibody specifically designed to target HER2,
inhibiting the downstream signaling pathways involved in HER2-driven breast
cancer growth and survival. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy
in HER2+ breast cancer models, both as a monotherapy and in combination with
other agents. This open-label study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
Bleegblorgumab in combination with Prednisolone in HER2+ MBC patients who have
received prior HER2-directed therapy.

Methods: 
This open-label, single-arm study enrolled HER2+ MBC patients who had
received prior HER2-directed therapy. Bleegblorgumab was administered
intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg every three weeks, in conjunction with oral
Prednisolone at 10 mg/day. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR),
while secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS), and safety.

Assessment and Endpoints: 
Patients were evaluated at regular intervals for treatment response and safety
assessments. Radiographic imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was performed to assess tumor response based
on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.

The primary endpoint of the study was the overall response rate (ORR), defined
as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial
response (PR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS),
overall survival (OS), and safety.

ORR was assessed by an independent review committee, and responses were
categorized according to RECIST criteria. PFS was defined as the time from
treatment initiation to disease progression or death from any cause. OS was
calculated from the start of treatment until death from any cause or the last
follow-up visit.

Safety assessments included monitoring and documentation of adverse events (AEs)
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
guidelines. AEs were graded for severity, and the relationship to the study
treatment was determined.

Statistical Analysis:
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demographics, baseline
characteristics, and treatment outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to
estimate PFS and OS, and the log-rank test was used for between-group
comparisons. The ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were reported with their
corresponding confidence intervals.

Results:
Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics:
A total of 50 HER2+ MBC patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was
54 years (range: 36-72), and the majority of patients had received prior
trastuzumab-based therapy. Baseline characteristics, including hormone receptor
status and metastatic sites, were well-balanced among the study population.

Efficacy Outcomes:
The combination of Bleegblorgumab and Prednisolone demonstrated promising
efficacy in HER2+ MBC patients. The ORR was 70%, with 35 patients achieving a
partial response and 7 patients achieving a complete response. The DCR, which
included stable disease, was 92%.

The median PFS was 12.5 months, indicating a significant delay in disease
progression. The median OS was not reached at the time of data analysis,
suggesting a potential survival benefit with this combination therapy.

Results: 
A total of 50 HER2+ MBC patients were enrolled in the study. The median
age was 54 years (range: 36-72), and the majority had received prior
trastuzumab-based therapy. The ORR was 70%, with 35 patients achieving a partial
response and 7 patients achieving a complete response. The disease control rate
was 92%. The median PFS was 12.5 months, and the median OS was not reached at
the time of data analysis. Adverse events were generally manageable, with the
most common being fatigue, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy.

Safety Profile:
The combination of Bleegblorgumab and Prednisolone was generally well-tolerated.
Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly
reported AEs included fatigue, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy. No unexpected
safety concerns were identified, and no treatment-related deaths occurred during
the study period.

Discussion:
The results of this open-label study demonstrate the promising efficacy and
manageable safety profile of Bleegblorgumab in combination with Prednisolone in
HER2+ MBC patients. The high ORR and DCR, along with the significant improvement
in PFS, suggest that this treatment regimen may offer a valuable therapeutic
option for HER2+ MBC patients who have previously received HER2-directed
therapy.

The combination of Bleegblorgumab, a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody, with
Prednisolone, an immunomodulatory agent, may enhance anti-tumor activity and
overcome treatment resistance. The favorable safety profile supports the
feasibility of administering this combination in the clinical setting.

However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study, including
its open-label design and single-center setting. Larger randomized controlled
trials are needed to confirm these findings and further evaluate the long-term
safety and efficacy of Bleegblorgumab in combination with Prednisolone in HER2+
MBC patients.
